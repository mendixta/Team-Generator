# Team Profile Generator 

# Summary:
For this assignment, we were asked to build a node.js command-line application that takes information about employees on a team, which then generates an HTML page where it displays summaries for each person on the team.

# Installation:
The following packages are needed in order ot run the Team Profile Generator app on the command line. 
- inquirer: npm i inquirer 
- jest: npm i jest 

# Getting Started / Issues:
One of the first things that I decided to do before getting started on any of the code that will run in the command line, was creating a basic HTML page with some CSS that will serve as the template for when the team HTML page is generated. There were three differnt cards that were created in this template, a card for the manager, engineer, and intern. This HTML template was then later applied to the code which helped generate our team.


Next, the node.js portion was built: One of the issues that I had while creating the code for the app, was that the inquirer.prompt sometimes would run on the command line when the test command was typed, and sometimes nothing would happen. Other times, when it was time to render the HTML page, only certain parts of the HTML would render, and others didnt.
